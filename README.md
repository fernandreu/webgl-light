# A simple WebGL Engine
A lightweight game engine made with pure WebGL, together with a simple demo making use of it.

The original idea behind this was to experiment with the capabilities that pure WebGL can offer. Hence, no third-party graphical libraries (such as [three.js](https://threejs.org/)) were used.

The project rapidly took the shape of a game engine which encapsulated most of the direct WebGL API calls. However, this project is not as refined / mature as one of the fully-fledged graphical libraries / game engines out there, and was developed as a proof of concept only. Use at your own risk!

The engine is developed using the ES6 standard of JavaScript, and uses [glMatrix](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix) (included as part of in this repo) to perform mathematical operations.
